Made with ‚ù§ by Becklyn

A framework that supports you in creating CRUD APIs using go (golang).

This framework is useful for applications that use [fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) as router and [gorm](https://gorm.io/) as ORM. 


Installation
------------

```shell
go get -u github.com/Becklyn/gocruddy
```


Usage
-----

You can find a working example in the `example` directory of this repository.
The folder also contains a postman template that demonstrates the API usage.


Development
-----------

Set up your local development environment:

````shell
make setup
````

Add new modules / dependencies:

```shell
make install MOD=your.dependency/name
```

Tidy up modules:

```shell
make tidy
```

Test your implementation:

```shell
make test
```

Calculate the code coverage:
(This currently requires a local go installation)

```shell
make cover
```
